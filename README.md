# Periodic Table of Elementals
From tiny hydrogen elementals to enormous uranium elements and beyond, this book is filled with an incredible variety of elementals with powers as diverse as the chemical elements they embody.
 
In this chemistry-inspired fantasy book, you will find elementals for each of the 118 known elements with abilities and lore based on real chemistry, science-themed items and spells, useful tables and optional rules, a map of the Island of Stability, and a short adventure to introduce the bookâ€™s elementals in any fantasy setting.

Meditate with xenon elementals, summon cute elemental familiars, ride tungsten elementals to battle, face the radioactive fury of plutonium eletungsten elementals, or explore the bizarre properties of superheavy elementals, all mentals, brought to life with detailed illustrations and science-inspired lore!

Time to (chemically) transform your games!
